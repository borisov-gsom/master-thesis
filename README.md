# Sales Prediction Model Based on Weather Data

## Description:
This work presents a sales prediction model for retail, incorporating weather factors using machine learning.
Goals and Tasks:
- Analyze existing demand forecasting methods
- Analyze existing weather forecast data providers
- Collect and preprocess sales and weather data
- Build and compare CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost models
- Build fine-tuned models for each product category
- Analyze the impact of weather factors
- Provide financial assessment of the implementation

## Structure:
- scr - Python files for preprocessing pipeline
- notebooks - Jypiter notebooks with visualisations of preprocessing, experiments and final models calculations

## Results:
The model improved demand forecasting accuracy for Lenta for specific groups of products.
